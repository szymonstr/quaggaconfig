# the daemon will not be started by /etc/init.d/quagga. The permissions should
# be u=rw,g=r,o=.
# When using "vtysh" such a config file is also needed. It should be owned by
# group "quaggavty" and set to ug=rw,o= though. Check /etc/pam.d/quagga, too.

# The watchquagga daemon is always started. Per default in monitoring-only but
# that can be changed via /etc/quagga/debian.conf.
